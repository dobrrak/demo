          The very first time I started wondering how everything works.
        </li>
        <li>
          Why to bother? because something stopped working.
        </li>
        <li>
          That time on Windows 98 I used to play Worms 2! The Game required a CD in the drive to launch it. As weeks passed, the CD became scratched more and more and finally became unreadable. No internet back then. No other copies.
        </li>
        <li>
          I was really frustrated, I couldn't play the game anymore.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nowadays I would simply use a no cd crack everyone can download.
        </li>
        <br \>
          <!-- <strong>Then one day one cousin came up with a fix!</strong> -->
        </ul>
        <!-- <ol>
          <li>
            First, disassemble the CD drive casing.
          </li>
          <li>Then plug the drive into PC naked.</li>
          <li>Put the CD in, boot Wins and try to open contents of this scratched cd. As expected, it did not work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Here comes the magic</strong>. See, there is a little screw near the laser. It is a set screw, which adjusts the laser lenses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eject the CD. Use a screw driver to turn the screw by a quarter.
          </li>
          <li>Insert the CD again. Still not reading? Make another quarter turn.</li>
          </ol> -->
          <br \>
          <!-- <ul>
          <li>
            After several turns it suddenly  worked! I could read the CD contents and launch my game! Awesome!
          </li>
          <li>
            As a final approach I created an ISO image with CloneCD. Sooner or later the CD will break completely. Better to emulate cdrom and mount ISO image. Also it is faster.
          </li>
          <br>
            <strong>
              The worms in arms went to war again!

          I learned HTML, JavaScript and PHP. As an experiment I created a phishing site that collected user credentials and saved them to a remote database.
        </li>
        <li>
          After a few hours I got few hundreds of them. I wiped the site down without any evil action. Is it really that easy to fool somebody?
