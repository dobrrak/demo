          <strong>Then one day one cousin came up with a fix!</strong>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>
            First, disassemble the CD drive casing.
          </li>
          <li>Then plug the drive into PC naked.</li>
          <li>Put the CD in, boot Wins and try to open contents of this scratched cd. As expected, it did not work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Here comes the magic</strong>. See, there is a little screw near the laser. It is a set screw, which adjusts the laser lenses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eject the CD. Use a screw driver to turn the screw by a quarter.
          </li>
          <li>Insert the CD again. Still not reading? Make another quarter turn.</li>
          </ol>
          <br \>
          <ul>
          <li>
            After several turns it suddenly  worked! I could read the CD contents and launch my game! Awesome!
          </li>
          <li>
            As a final approach I created an ISO image with CloneCD. Sooner or later the CD will break completely. Better to emulate cdrom and mount ISO image. Also it is faster.
          </li>
          <br>
            <strong>
              The worms in arms went to war again!
            </strong>

          I learned HTML, JavaScript and PHP.

          As an experiment I created a phishing site that collected user credentials and saved them to a remote database.

          After a few hours I got few hundreds of them.

          I wiped the site down without any evil action

          It consists of 4 timer clock for pool billiard , for carambol and so for snooker.

        <li>
           Each of them has different pricing.
        </li>
        <li>
           In the app you simply start the timers and after stopping it calculates price to bill the customer and log the profit.
        </li>
